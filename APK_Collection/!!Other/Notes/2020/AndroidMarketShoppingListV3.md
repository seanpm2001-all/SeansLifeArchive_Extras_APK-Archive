## Downloads (October 4th 2020)

I didn't plan on doing any downloads today, as there is very little left. I remembered stupid zombies today, and when I went to get it, I got completely locked out of apkpure due to hCaptcha completely breaking. I can no longer use the site. I thought hCaptcha would be somewhat tolerable, but it seems to just be an issue. I am not paying for privacy pass, I am just going to have to find another site that is better and doesn't use hCaptcha. Fuck you CloudFlare.
